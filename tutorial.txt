Program Tutorial

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

1. Setting Up the Bot

Go to "https://discord.com/developers/applications", and click Create New Application.
Choose a name and create the application.
On the side, select the Bot Tab.
Customize the bot's name and profile picture.
Enable Message Content, Server Members, and Presence Intents.

2. 0Auth2 Scopes

Go to the 0Auth2 tab. For a redirect uri, enter:
"https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=[INSERT CLIENT ID]&scope=bot"
with your bot's client id.
Select the scopes you need. For a bot, select the "Bot" scope
Select "Manage Roles", "Read Messages / View Channels", "Send Messages", "Send Messages in Threads", "Send TTS Messages", "Read Message History", and "Add Reactions"

3. Adding the Bot to a Server

Copy and paste the Generated URL at the bottom into your browser to add a bot to your requested server.
Congrats, your bot is now in your server!

4. Installing Python & Discord.py

Install a Python Editor (not an online one).
Then, go to your terminal and type "pip install discord.py"

5. Running the Code

Open the Python Editor, and enter the code in "basic_discord_bot_login.py"
Go back to the Developer Portal, and copy the token.
NEVER share your bot's token. Also changing it will cause the program to break.
Run the Python Program, and follow the steps
And you're done!

6. Troubleshooting

If you're having problems, ensure that all the steps are followed, the bot has the correct permissions, and that
discord.py and Python are up to date.
